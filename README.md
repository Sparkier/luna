# Luna

Inspired by [Lucid](https://github.com/tensorflow/lucid), **Luna** is a Feature Visualization package for Tensorflow.
While Lucid does not support Tensorflow 2, **Luna** was built with Tensorflow 2 at its core.

**Luna is under active development. It is research code and not production-ready.**

To learn how to use Luna and for insights into its API, see our [documentation](http://a13x.io/luna/).

## Contributing

We greatly appreciate any effort to improve **Luna**.
If you want to contribute to its development, see our [contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Community

While we admire their work, we have no affiliation with the Lucid authors or project. Nonetheless, if you are interested in research like this, the Distill slack ([join link](http://slack.distill.pub)) might be a good place for you to get to know other people in this area.

On the awesome Distill slack, Lucid has its own `#proj-lucid` channel, where general questions about the technology are discussed.
