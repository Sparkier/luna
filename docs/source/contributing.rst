Contribution ideas
------------------
- At the moment, gradient ascent is used as optimizer. However, adding compatibility for the Adam optimizer might yield better results.
- Luna requires a high number of learning rate and iterations: investigations on how to imporve the regularization and optimization techniques are a welocme contribution.
- The suggested transformation from Lucid, do not produce the exact same color and lacks of sharpness. Contribution towards better imaging in TF2 is appreciated.
